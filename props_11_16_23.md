## Joe and Mingwei Discussion 11/16/23

**Definition ??**: The output of operator `delta` is *integrable* if `S -> delta -> fold<'static> = S -> fold<'static>` .

----
Let's start with a simple case. `fold` vs. `lattice_fold` and `'tick` vs. `'static`.

**Assume input order is fixed, but parenthesization of input is non-deterministic.**

- `fold[f]` with non-associative `f` produces a non-deterministic stream.

- `fold<'tick>[f]` with associative `f` produces an *integrable* stream: `fold<'tick>[f] -> fold<'static>[f] = fold<'static>[f]`
- `fold<'static>[f]` with associative `f` produces an *integrable* stream **and** a deterministic final result.
- `lattice_fold<'tick>` is associative by definition, and produces a *monotonic, integrable* stream.
- `lattice_fold<'static>` is associative by definition, and produces a *monotonic integrable* stream **and** a deterministic final result.

*Note (downgrade fold<static> on monotonic input)*: given a *monotonic* input stream, `fold[f]` with associative `f` produces the same output stream with `static` or `tick` semantics.

----
**Definition**: Given map function $m: T_1 \rightarrow T_2$, and fold functions $f<T>:T \rightarrow T$ on $T_1$ and $T_2$, `m` is a *morphism* w.r.t. `f` iff i.e. `f(m(x1), m(x2)) = m(f(x1, x2))`

*Observation (morphisms commute with fold)*: `fold[f] -> map[m] = map[m] -> fold[f]` if `m` a morphism wrt `f`.

---
Let's not confuse `atomize` and `diff`! 
- `diff` takes an input stream and produces a corresponding output stream of differences between adjacent pairs in the input.
- `atomize` is kind of like `flatten`, where the types of input and output are the same (e.g. `atomize` would turn a stream of `set<T>` into a stream of `singleton_set<T>`, where `flatten` would turn a stream of `set<T>` into a stream of `T`). 

I: [S][S + {x}][S + {x} + {s_1}][{}]...
I': [S][{x}][{}][{}]...
I' -> atomize: [{s1}][{s2}]...[{sn}][{x}][{x}]... 
lattice_merge(I) = lattice_merge(diff(I)) = lattice_merge(atomize(diff(I)))

---

```
// f associative
S -> diff -> fold<'static>[f] 
  = S -> atomize -> fold<'static>[f]
  = S -> fold<'static>[f]

// Sm monotonic, f associative
Sm -> fold<'static>[f]
  = Sm -> fold<'tick>[f]
```

## Back to Hydroflow. 
*Want to know, given an input stream, if network non-determinism will cause output non-determinism.*
1. Running result non-determinism (hard to avoid with arbitrary parenthesization)
2. Final result non-determinism is what we hope to achieve.
    - And possibly Conor's termination detection as well

### Our model, through the lens of DBSP
- We have streams with ticks (arbitrary, non-overlapping, adjacent windows). 
- We have ops that work on either a static (running prefix of a stream) or per-tick basis.
- Static ops + differentiation is the basic form of DBSP
  - our 'tick semantics should correspond to window functions
- Let's assume we don't have the `diff` operator of DBSP in Hydroflow (for now.)
